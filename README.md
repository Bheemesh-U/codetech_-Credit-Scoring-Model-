: Credit Scoring Model 
# 🏦 Credit Scoring Model

This project is a Machine Learning-based **Credit Scoring Model** designed to predict an individual's creditworthiness based on financial history. It is part of my internship tasks at [CodeAlpha](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codealpha/), where I gained hands-on experience in supervised learning and real-world financial data modeling.

## 📌 Objective

To build a classification model that evaluates the risk of granting credit to individuals based on their financial and personal data.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes the following types of features:

- **Income**
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Credit History Length**
- **Number of Late Payments**
- **Employment Status**
- **Credit Utilization Rate**
- **Other Demographics (age, marital status, etc.)**

> 📊 You can use synthetic data or real datasets like the German Credit Dataset or the LendingClub dataset (publicly available).

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation matrix
   - Feature importance
4. **Model Training**
5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - ROC-AUC Curve
6. **Model Selection & Conclusion**

## 📈 Results

- The best-performing model was **Random Forest**, achieving an accuracy of over **XX%** and an ROC-AUC score of **YY** (you can fill your actual values).
- The model is effective in identifying high-risk applicants with a balanced trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
